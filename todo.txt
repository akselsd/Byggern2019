Change joystick to interrupt driven? 
Find delay for joystick rd to wr
Offset with absolute value instead of percent (joystick)
Fix full range for positive joystick values (now max is 99)
Fix oled clear screen for cursor
Fix OLED interrupt optimalization
Implement LOAD TX BUFFER and READ RX BUFFER (Save one SPI cycle pr msg)
Const qualifier

IMPORTANT:
Make frequency map. Make sure that all data sent is received, by not sending data too frequently.


--> Add filter for message reception

Make joystick and slider structs common, msg to status and status to msg functions
Interrupt driven ADC conversion for IR diodes

OPTIONALS:
Extend menu select to select and display character e.g. Mario, DK, etc
