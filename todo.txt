Change joystick to interrupt driven? 
Find delay for joystick rd to wr
Offset with absolute value instead of percent (joystick)
Fix full range for positive joystick values (now max is 99)
Fix oled clear screen for cursor
Fix OLED interrupt optimalization
Implement LOAD TX BUFFER and READ RX BUFFER (Save one SPI cycle pr msg)
Const qualifier
Op amp for ir reciever? See assigment DONE
Diode snubber for relay, in serial or parallell to GND? PRETTY MUCH DONE

IMPORTANT:
Make frequency map. Make sure that all data sent is received, by not sending data too frequently.
Dont use IR_driver for scoring goals
Make CAN interrupt driven.


--> Add filter for message reception

Make joystick and slider structs common, msg to status and status to msg functions
Interrupt driven ADC conversion for IR diodes

OPTIONALS:
Extend menu select to select quit in game.
Extend to speakers
Fix regulator bias
Implement lives-- when goal conceded
Implement different difficulties
Implement music
Update score logic: e.g. seconds played - goals conceded

TODO TODAY
Set treshold for encoder value
